/**
 * ListCardPrototype.js
 *
 * Stamps out the cards that fill the home screen, one per list the user owns.
 * Each card carries the list's name in bold on the left, a count underneath, and
 * a delete button on the right.
 *
 * Every card is stamped with data-list-id. That is what lets the HomeView listen
 * for clicks in one single place, on the container, and still work out which list
 * was clicked. See HomeView for why that matters.
 *
 * This class is finished, and it is the worked example for the one you have to
 * write: ItemCardPrototype does the same job for the cards inside an open list.
