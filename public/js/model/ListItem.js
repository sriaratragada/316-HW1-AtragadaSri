/**
 * ListItem.js
 *
 * One row inside a Wolfie List: what has to be done, when it was entered, how
 * urgent it is, when it is meant to be finished, and whether it is finished.
 *
 * PROTOTYPE DESIGN PATTERN
 * ------------------------
 * This class carries a clone() method. Rather than a caller having to know which
 * fields a ListItem has in order to copy one, it asks an existing item to produce
 * a copy of itself. That existing item is the prototype. This is what the
 * duplicate button on every item card uses, and it is also how the item modal
 * takes a snapshot of an item before editing so that the edit can be undone.
 *
 * ENCAPSULATION, AND THE ONE PROBLEM IT CAUSES HERE
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * Every field is private. Nothing outside this class can reach in and set a date
 * to last Tuesday: reading goes through the getters below, and the only way to
 * change an item is applyValues(), which cleans everything on the way in.
 *
 * That has one consequence worth understanding, because it is a genuine trap.
 * JSON.stringify cannot see private fields at all, so an item written to local
 * storage would come back as {} and every saved list would silently lose its
 * contents. The toJSON() method at the bottom is what prevents that: stringify
 * calls it if it exists, so it is the one place that decides what a saved item
 * looks like. Add a field and it must be added there too.
